this eve I got the follwoing text message by “Erinnerung” to my mobile number:

> Guten Tag  
Termin morgen 06.12. um 10:10 Uhr  
MVZ Neuhausen am Rotkreuzplatz  
Rotkreuzplatz 1 80634  
089 45 20 93 20  
Mehr Infos: <https://m.doctolib.de/fds27>

“Mehr Infos” gives

> “Geben Sie die ersten 3 Buchstaben Ihres Familiennamens ein, um Ihre Termine zu verwalten:”

the only mehr info I haven't yet got by text message is the specialty of the doctor I have an appointment at.

I'm pretty sure I didn't sign a permission for this bullshit.

it is the mobile number I gave to the MVZ quite a while ago.
how do they know it's still my number?
I might just have forgotten to withdraw it.
I might have given my contract and my number to my ex-boyfriend, my boss or my stepfather.
I might have an appointment at a psychiatrist's office, a venerologist's office, whatever.
I might have installed stupid apps requiring to read my text messages.

Thanks a lot, MVZ Neuhausen, thank you [Doctolib](https://doctolib.de) for this uberfriendly reminder.
